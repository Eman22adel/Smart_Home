 Smart-Home System with Admin and Guest Modes is a cutting-edge project designed to enhance the convenience, security, and efficiency of modern living spaces

# Description:
 Leveraging the power of microcontrollers, LCD displays, timers, EEPROM, and the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) protocol, this system offers seamless management of home automation functionalities.

# Key Features:
 Dual Mode Access: The system operates in two distinct modes: Admin and Guest. Each mode offers different levels of access and control over the smart home features.

Microcontroller Architecture: Utilizing two microcontrollers - a master and a slave - ensures efficient processing and distributed control throughout the smart-home network. The master controller serves as the central hub for overall system management, while the slave controller executes specific tasks and interacts with peripheral devices.

LCD Interface: A user-friendly LCD interface provides real-time status updates, menu navigation, and interaction prompts for effortless user engagement. The display communicates vital information regarding system operations, mode selection, and device statuses.

Timer Functionality: Integrated timers enable scheduled automation of various home appliances and devices. Users can program specific activation and deactivation times for lights, HVAC systems, and other electronic components, optimizing energy consumption and enhancing convenience.

EEPROM Storage: Persistent storage using EEPROM ensures that user preferences, settings, and access permissions are retained even in the event of power loss or system restart. This feature guarantees a seamless and personalized user experience across multiple sessions.

SPI Protocol Communication: The SPI protocol facilitates high-speed, full-duplex communication between the master and slave microcontrollers, enabling rapid data exchange and synchronization of system commands. This streamlined communication protocol ensures efficient coordination of smart-home operations.

# Applications:
Home Automation: Control lighting, temperature, security systems, and entertainment devices with ease and precision.
Guest Management: Customize access permissions and restrictions for guests, ensuring security and privacy.
Energy Optimization: Implement scheduled automation to minimize energy consumption and reduce utility costs.
Convenience and Comfort: Enjoy the convenience of automated tasks and personalized settings tailored to individual preferences.
